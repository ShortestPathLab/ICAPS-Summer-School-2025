        # we're not colliding into other agents in the reservation table.

        # üè∑Ô∏è A2 EXERCISE: IMPLEMENT THE WAIT ACTION
        #
        # Now we're dealing with the time dimension, robots can now wait.
        # Here, we need to determine if the robot can wait on a tile.
        # If so, we need to add a wait action to the list.
